First post is dedicated to my mentor Anuvrat. Who just loves corn. So the lesson learnt was that corn are availble in two forms. First is the one you get on sweet corn shop. They are easy to boil and gets soft easily. While the other one are small in size. They don't get soft easily. For them presure cooker is required. Just pour water double the corn. Then boil them, Eureka it would be more soften than if they had been boiled in pan.
